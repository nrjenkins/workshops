// You've made it to the final assessment! In this final assignment you will 
// need to build a model to predict the value of diamonds. This will require 
// you to clean the data set and present your results. 

// Data Cleaning //

// 1. Import the data


// 2. Give all variables informative names. 


// 3. Label the values of the `cut` variable.



// Data Exploration //

// 1. Get the summary statistics for all the variables in your data.


// 2. Plot the distribution of diamond prices. 


// 3. Plot the relationship between the clarity of a diamond and its price. 



// Data Modeling //

// 1. Build a model to predict the price of a diamond using the cut, carat, 
// clarity, and color.


// 2. Create an informative table of the model's results. 


// 3. Create a coefficient plot of the model's results. 


// 4. Predict the value of a 4 carat diamond with a very good cut, J color, and 
// VVS2 clarity.
