## Messy Data is ... Messy

* Most of data sets you will work with are difficult get information from

* Data can be:

  * In the wrong format
  
  * Spread across multiple files
  
  * Badly coded, or have errors
  
  * Incomplete with values missing
  
* Informative variable names and value labels make our data eaiser to use
  
## Data Cleaning

* Data cleaning will probably be the most time-intensive task of any project

* But it's vital!

* A clean data set maximizes the amount of information we can use

## Clean Data

Variables are in columns, observations are in rows, and values are in cells

## Data Formats

Here, each row is a case and each column is a variable

```{r}
tidyr::table1
```

## Data Formats

```{r}
tidyr::table2
```

## Data Formats

```{r}
tidyr::table3
```

## Types of Variables

* Numeric variables

* Character variables

* Factors

* Dates

## Time for Hands-on Practice!
